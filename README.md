To  investigate the file system, I used the seek function to find the the location of various offsets and read the required number of bytes while encoding in hex. 
The hex string is converted to a list and the bytes are then swapped.Furthermore, the .join function is used to join the data to create a string, which is then converted to decimal. 

To obtain the bonus images: Search using Jpeg magic numbers from FF D8 to FF D9.
Copy the data into the hex editor, and save
